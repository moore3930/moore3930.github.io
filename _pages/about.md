======
Hi, thanks for your attention!

I am now working at *Baidu* as an algorithm engineer. I designed a fast non-autoregressive model for joint intent detection
and slot filling, named [SlotRefine](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.02693.pdf), 
which achieve better performance and efficiency for online [DuerOS](https://dueros.baidu.com/en/index.html) system.

I worked at *Alibaba* as an algorithm engineer from 2018 to 2019. My main job is to design deep learning algorithms to
make *Taobao* recommendation system works better. Before that I got my MS degree from 
[*Peking University*](http://english.pku.edu.cn/) in 2018. 

I have also spent some fun time interning at *XiaoIce Group, Microsoft, Beijing (2017-2018)*.

My main interests lies within Natural Language Processing, such as Cross-lingual Word Emebddings and Machine Translation.

**NEW:** Actively seeking for Ph.D. opportunities starting from 2021 Fall.
