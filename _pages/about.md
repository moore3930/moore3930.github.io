Hi, thanks for your attention!

I am now working at [*Baidu*](https://www.baidu.com/) as a senior algorithm engineer. 
I designed and built a fast non-autoregressive model for joint intent detection and slot filling, 
named [*SlotRefine*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.02693.pdf), which achieves better performance and efficiency for online
[*DuerOS*](https://dueros.baidu.com/en/index.html) system.

I worked at [*Alibaba*](https://www.alibabagroup.com/en/global/home) as an algorithm engineer from 2018 to 2019. 
At that time, my main job was to design deep learning algorithms to make [*Taobao*](https://www.taobao.com/) 
recommendation system works better. Before that, I had also spent some fun time interning at
*XiaoIce Group, Microsoft, Beijing (2017-2018)*.

I got my MS degree from the [*EECS*](https://eecs.pku.edu.cn/Home/HOME.htm) at 
[*Peking University*](http://english.pku.edu.cn/) in 2018. 

My main interests lie within Natural Language Processing, such as Cross-lingual Word Emebddings and Machine Translation.

**NEW:** Actively seeking for Ph.D. opportunities starting from 2021 Fall.
