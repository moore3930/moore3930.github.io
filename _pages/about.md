About me
======
Hi, thanks for your attention!

I am now working at *Baidu* as an algorithm engineer.

I worked at *Alibaba* as an algorithm engineer from 2018 to 2019. My main job is to design deep learning algorithms to
make *Taobao* recommendation works better. Before that I got my MS degree from *Peking University* in 2018. 

I have also spent some fun time interning at *XiaoIce Group, Microsoft, Beijing (2017-2018)*.

My research interests lies within Natural Language Processing, such as Cross-lingual Word Emebddings and Machine Translation.

**NEW:** Actively seeking for Ph.D. opportunities starting from 2021 Fall.
