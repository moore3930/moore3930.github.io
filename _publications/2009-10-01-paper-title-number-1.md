Slot filling and intent detection are two main tasks in spoken language understanding (SLU) system. In this paper, 
we propose a novel non-autoregressive model named SlotRefine for joint intent detection and slot filling. Besides, 
we design a novel two-pass iteration mechanism to handle the uncoordinated slots problem caused by conditional 
independence of non-autoregressive model. Experiments demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms previous 
models in slot filling task, while considerably speeding up the decoding (up to $\times$10.77). In-depth analyses show 
that 1) pretraining schemes could further enhance our model; 2) two-pass mechanism indeed remedy the uncoordinated slots.
